# LEDControllerProject
Class project to control LEDs on TI 3220S Lanchpad through a terminal

    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This project involved creating a serial connection through the terminal to the Texas Instruments CC3220s Launchpad. The goal was to be able to control the board's LEDs through UART text input.
  
    What did you do particularly well?
  I used functions, interrupts, and the UART well.

    Where could you improve?
  I could improve in how robust my code is. It feels too "hard-coded" to me. I think it could be cleaned up further to make it more efficient.

    What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  This is my first real embedded programming class and was my first challenging project in the class. It has really changed the way I think about embedded software and has especially changed the way I approach and plan projects. I will definitely spend more time planning on all of my future projects.

    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  Embedded programming requires very strict, clean code and a lot of planning to make sure you're not introducing bugs and/or using too much memory/resources. The attention to detail required for embedded programming will follow me into other projects and courses.

    How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I made this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable through the use of clear comments and variable/function names.
